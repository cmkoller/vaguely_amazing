        %p "ToSS: Trials of Sword and Staff" is a cooperative dexterity game that combines classic gameplay elements from fantasy RPGs and beer pong. Players become mighty heroes fighting to slay monsters and loot treasure - all by throwing ping pong balls into cups.

        %p In ToSS, your team will embark on a choose-your-own-adventure style adventure through a series of scenarios, each featuring unique foes and objectives. You will earn levels as a warrior or a wizard, explore exciting new powers, and most importantly, get to have fun whatever your skill level.

        %p Here are just a few features of ToSS:

        %ul
          %li Unique class & leveling systems that reward both sinking and missing tosses
          %li 45+ different item cards that grant special powers and can be traded to create powerful combinations
          %li 16 distinct scenarios woven into a choose-your-own-adventure style scenario booklet
          %li Custom cups (16), balls (3), and full-art backboard included
          %li Strategic decision-making and gameplay

        %p Our Kickstarter campaign goes live on <strong>Wednesday, May 25th.</strong> We’ve shared ToSS with over 100 people already, and we can’t wait to release it fully into the wild. We’ve also partnered with Game Over Boston as their official "pong game for gamers," and are proud to be a part of their events this Spring.

        %blockquote ToSS has been a smash hit at our events, it is now the official pong game of Game Over.  There is always a line throughout the night of people waiting to try it out for themselves.  I recommend it to anyone who loves fun.

        %blockquote This was a very interesting and highly amusing take on traditional Pong-style games. The variation in the scenarios and progression of the story allowed for a surprising amount of strategic depth given that the mechanics are always the same.
        %blockquote I was very impressed at the amount of flexibility at my disposal.
        %blockquote It was deep enough that it held my interest far more than a standard party game...I'd never go back to ordinary Beer Pong or Flip Cup!
